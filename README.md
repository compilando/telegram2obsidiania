# üß† Knowledge Organization with Obsidian and Zettelkasten üåê

Welcome to the **Knowledge Organization Project**! This repository aims to revolutionize how we manage and explore knowledge by combining the **Zettelkasten method** with the powerful capabilities of **Obsidian**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In my daily routine, I use Telegram's "Saved Messages" feature to send myself reminders and content. However, by the end of the day, this content often becomes disorganized and piles up.

To address this, I created a script, supported by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, to:
- Integrate this content into an **Obsidian Vault**.
- Leverage the power of LLMs to expand and enrich the base content.

### **Why is this project innovative?**
This project integrates:
1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Parent, sibling, and child topics structured intuitively.
2. **Semantic Linking**: Cross-referencing topics using Obsidian's [[WikiLinks]].
3. **Enriched Markdown Content**: Rich, contextual content with additional resources to deepen understanding.
4. **Dynamic Knowledge System**: A Vault that fosters meaningful connections and deep thinking.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Folders**: Organizes topics into parent, sibling, and child relationships.
- **Smart Navigation**: Cross-references topics and connects ideas seamlessly.
- **Content Expansion**: Utilizes LLMs to add context, enrich existing content, and generate new insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. Each topic is stored in a folder with structured subfolders for related concepts.
2. Files in each folder contain:
   - Rich, contextual content.
   - Cross-references to other topics using Obsidian's [[WikiLinks]].
   - Additional resources to deepen understanding.
