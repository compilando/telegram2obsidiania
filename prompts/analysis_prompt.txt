I provide you with a JSON containing entries (date, text, and link) related to various topics, from which I want to build an Obsidian Vault.

You are an expert in hierarchical information processing, semantics, and creating Obsidian Vaults using the Zettelkasten method.
Your task is to analyze this information and organize the data intelligently and hierarchically.
The final output should be a JSON document representing a structure of folders and files.
Use the Zettelkasten method (applied to folder names, files, cross-links, etc.) to organize all the information logically and effectively.

Content Requirements:

** Hierarchical Organization:**
Each main topic must be converted into a "folder" element in the final JSON, with related subfolders:
- Parent Folder: A more general topic encompassing the main topic.
- Sibling Folders: Complementary related topics.
- Child Folders: Derived or specific subtopics.

1) First, review all the elements to create this hierarchical structure, considering them all.
2) Then, process each element again to include it in the corresponding folder.

** Enriched Files:**
Each folder must contain:

- A main file (.md):
- Content based on the text and links from the input JSON:
- A descriptive and clear title: Ensure it is descriptive and engaging.
- A detailed explanation of the main topic (at least 4 extensive paragraphs).
- Add more context and related ideas to enhance the fileâ€™s informational value.
- A list of relevant cross-references as Markdown links (minimum of 3).
- Cross-references to related folders or files (format [[FileName]]).
- Explicit connection to parent, sibling, and child topics.
- At least 3 descriptive #tags.
- Always leave at least 3 line breaks between the above elements.
- Five additional files (.md):
  Each file should be based on a related topic, with a link, descriptive title, expanded description, and additional relevant links.


**Content Enrichment:**

Always add contextual information to expand on the concepts.
Conduct brief research to include examples or additional links helpful in understanding each topic.


**Best Practices:**

Always generate related content that expands and enriches the original content.
Add explanations or additional contexts based on the link's topic. At least two extensive and relevant paragraphs.

**Output Format:**

Final Vault language will be ({language}).
JSON to process: {json_data}


Return **only** a JSON with the following structure:
{{
  "folders": [
    {{
      "name": "MainFolderName",
      "subfolders": [
        {{
          "name": "SubfolderName",
          "files": [
            {{
              "name": "File1.md",
              "content": "Initial content of File1..."
            }}
          ]
        }}
      ],
      "files": [
        {{
          "name": "RootFileInFolder.md",
          "content": "Initial content..."
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}
