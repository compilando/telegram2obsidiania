3. Architecture Recommendations
Modular Design:

Keep the JSON specification flexible so you can easily add or remove folders and notes without changing the core script.
For larger projects, separate the code for parsing JSON from the code that writes files (e.g., create a class for the data model).
Scalability:

If you plan on generating thousands of notes, consider asynchronous I/O (e.g., asyncio) or chunked processing to handle large writes efficiently.
For cloud-based solutions, store your JSON in a database or a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git) for collaboration.
Version Control & CI:

Store your JSON files and Python scripts in Git.
Use a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) to automate note generation and testing.
Potentially serve the generated vault to a static site or knowledge management system if needed.
Extensibility:

This approach works for any domain: simply modify or add folders in the JSON.
You can incorporate additional metadata (e.g., creation date, last modified date, authors, references, etc.) into the JSON and script.
Integration with Other Tools:

If you use other note-taking tools or want to embed attachments, extend the script to download or place attachments in attachments/.
Combine with Dataview or Templater in Obsidian to automatically generate indexes and navigation pages.
